# GPU Environment

Initial compatibility was demonstrated on 2026-09-29 with Python 3.13.12 and both GPU dynamics stacks. Reference-size dynamics, drive gradients, storage selection, and numerical refinement passed on this workstation on 2026-09-30. The project locks the optional cuDensityMat and dynamiqs dependencies. Validation covers the bundled fixtures; it makes no performance or arbitrary-system accuracy claim.

## Observed workstation and packages

| Component | Observed value |
|---|---|
| OS / architecture / kernel | Linux / x86_64 / `7.0.0-34-generic` |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, compute capability 12.0 |
| GPU memory reported by NVIDIA-SMI | 32607 MiB |
| NVIDIA driver | 595.91.07 |
| Loaded CUDA runtime / driver API | 12.9 / 13.2 |
| Python | 3.13.12 |
| QuTiP / qutip-cuquantum | 5.3.1 / 0.3.1 |
| cuquantum-python-cu12 / cudensitymat-cu12 | 26.9.0 / 0.7.0 |
| cupy-cuda12x | 14.2.0 |
| dynamiqs | 0.3.6 |
| JAX / jaxlib / CUDA plugin / CUDA PJRT | 0.6.2 |
| NumPy / SciPy | 2.5.3 / 1.18.1 |

The driver API value and loaded runtime identify different components. The initial compatibility probe used a disposable environment with `qutip-cuquantum[cuda12]` and `jax[cuda12]`; its full package snapshot is [m1_gpu.requirements.txt](../tests/probes/m1_gpu.requirements.txt). The project extras `cuquantum`, `differentiable-cuda12`, and CPU-only `differentiable` are now resolved in `uv.lock`; an installation's base includes `differentiable`, and its GPU component adds the other two. The compatibility tests below use exact syncs, so stray installed packages cannot influence them; runner jobs keep the plugins a user installs ([plugins](operations/runs.md#plugins-in-the-runner-environment)).

Dynamiqs 0.3.6 with JAX 0.11.2 and jaxtyping 0.3.11 failed at import with `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'types.UnionType' and 'str'` in its nested `QArrayLike` definition. JAX 0.6.2 resolved that failure and passed the GPU solve on the same Python version. This tested combination supports retaining Python 3.13.

## Compatibility result

The [probe](../tests/probes/m1_gpu.py) evolves an initially excited two-level system with `H = 2π × diag(0, 0.2) rad/ns` and `L = sqrt(0.01/ns) × |0><1|`. Eleven output times cover 0–50 ns. The excited-state population must agree with `exp(-0.01 × t)` within `1e-7`; the final trace error must be at most `1e-9`. Both engines use complex128 states, `rtol = 1e-9`, and `atol = 1e-11`.

| Engine / method | Maximum population error | Final trace error | Device evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| cuDensityMat through qutip-cuquantum / CuVern7 | `9.7244e-13` | `0` | `CuState` backed by a CuPy array on CUDA device 0; RTX 5090 identity queried |
| dynamiqs / Tsit5 | `1.0738e-10` | `0` | Returned complex128 state arrays on `cuda:0`; RTX 5090 identity queried |

[The retained JSON result](../tests/probes/m1_gpu_results.json) records all installed package versions, device identities, times, populations, solver settings, residuals, and execution timestamp for the initial probe. The engines ran sequentially in separate processes.

The [cuDensityMat](../tests/test_engine_cuquantum.py) and [dynamiqs](../tests/test_engine_dynamiqs.py) adapter suites passed on the RTX 5090. The [acceptance matrix](../tests/test_engine_acceptance.py) adds two-level, oscillator, and populated qubit–resonator evolution with constant and interval-valued controls, loss-disabled comparisons, independent Lindblad exponentials, and integration refinement. CPU QuTiP, CPU dynamiqs, and both CUDA adapters pass the same numerical limits. Separate oscillator/composite truncation refinements and scalar/piecewise nonzero drive gradients also pass. Complex coherences and seeded random complex initial states exercise state layout.

[Retained acceptance results](../tests/probes/m1_acceptance_results.json) contain exact commands, test counts, per-case residuals, package/device observations, lockfile digest, and source snapshots identified by each run. The largest state-reference residual is approximately `3.7e-8`, and the largest integration-refinement change is `3.4e-8`, below the `1e-7` limits. The lowest tested density-matrix eigenvalue is approximately `-7.1e-10`, above the `-1e-8` floor. [The numerical reference](operations/system-spec.md#numerical-checks-for-the-bundled-models) owns thresholds and rationale; [the selection policy](operations/system-spec.md#engine-selection-policy) owns engine choice by spec, user default and built-in rule, and its refusals. No harness dimension cap or pre-launch memory estimate is imposed.

After a test run, the [results collector](../tests/probes/collect_m1_acceptance.py) appends its JUnit counts and properties while retaining earlier runs and source snapshots. Run it before changing the tested sources: `python tests/probes/collect_m1_acceptance.py --junit new-run /tmp/report.xml 'exact test command'`. Generate the XML with `-o junit_family=legacy --junitxml=/tmp/report.xml` to retain numerical properties. Repeated `--junit` arguments collect multiple runs.

cuDensityMat storage tests compare evolved states with QuTiP below `1e-7` for diagonal, narrow-band, and dense operators, and compare factorized composites with the CPU and exact references. Dense is selected at 16 levels, Dia becomes `MultidiagonalOperator` at 17 levels (diagonal and banded), and a wide 20-level operator becomes `DenseOperator`. These checks establish functional selection on this stack; they do not measure a performance crossover.

Run the GPU adapter tests in separate processes after exact synchronization of both extras:

```sh
uv sync --locked --exact --extra cuquantum --extra differentiable-cuda12
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false uv run --locked --exact --extra cuquantum --extra differentiable-cuda12 pytest -q tests/test_engine_cuquantum.py tests/test_engine_acceptance.py -k 'not dynamiqs' -m gpu --require-gpu
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda,cpu uv run --locked --exact --extra cuquantum --extra differentiable-cuda12 pytest -q tests/test_engine_dynamiqs.py tests/test_engine_acceptance.py -k dynamiqs -m gpu --require-gpu
```

For CPU acceptance, use `uv run --locked --exact pytest -q`. The CPU-only optional lane uses `JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu uv run --locked --exact --extra differentiable pytest -q tests/test_engine_dynamiqs.py tests/test_engine_acceptance.py -m 'not gpu' -k 'dynamiqs or gradient'`. These exact runs keep GPU extras out of the CPU environment. `--require-gpu` turns missing devices and skipped GPU tests into failures. The GPU suites assert the engine and actual device identity; this workstation reports an RTX 5090. [Loss comparisons](../examples/dynamics_reference.py) and [differentiable evolution](../examples/differentiable_reference.py) provide runnable examples.

## Runner GPU environment check

The [runner environment test](../tests/test_gpu_environment.py) passes on the RTX 5090 in a separate exact test environment with both GPU extras. It matches device UUID `GPU-f2a6e8aa-b32b-ae8e-6dc6-03612dd6b829` and observes driver `595.91.07`, loaded CUDA `12.9.0` and native cuDensityMat `0.7.0`, with no memory estimate. The [GPU report](../tests/probes/m2_simulation_gpu.xml) retains the device observations and environment hash. This records pre-dispatch environment compatibility.

Run this check alone in a separate exact environment without reshaping the development or CPU runner environment:

```sh
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/var/tmp/entanglix-gpu-test uv run --locked --exact --extra cuquantum --extra differentiable-cuda12 pytest -q tests/test_gpu_environment.py -m gpu --require-gpu
```

The CPU cases in the same test file exercise missing dependencies, driver/library failures, invisible devices, and environment identity independent of memory availability. The [run reference](operations/runs.md#environment-and-code-provenance) defines the API and recorded fields.

## Installation disk use

Observed on this workstation on 2026-10-28. A job environment with both GPU extras takes 7.0 GB, 4.5 GB of it NVIDIA's CUDA libraries, which JAX and cuQuantum ship as wheels instead of using a system CUDA; this is why GPU engines are a separate component. In the [clean-install run](../tests/probes/clean_install_results.json), uv's shared cache took 0.86 GB, a first version with the Piccolo component 3.7 GB (mostly its Julia and precompiled depot), and a second, base-only version 185 MB more, its unchanged packages hardlinked from the shared cache. Hardlinking needs the cache and the installations on one filesystem; otherwise uv copies.

## Reproduce GPU compatibility from a source checkout

Run where the NVIDIA driver and GPU device are accessible.

```sh
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,driver_version,memory.total --format=csv,noheader
uv venv --python 3.13.12 /tmp/entanglix-gpu-probe/.venv
uv pip sync --python /tmp/entanglix-gpu-probe/.venv/bin/python \
  tests/probes/m1_gpu.requirements.txt
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false \
  MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/entanglix-gpu-probe/matplotlib \
  JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda,cpu \
  /tmp/entanglix-gpu-probe/.venv/bin/python tests/probes/m1_gpu.py \
  --output /tmp/entanglix-gpu-probe/reproduced.json
```

Allow CPU devices for JAX host callbacks while explicitly checking GPU placement of the simulated states. `JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda` alone failed a dynamiqs callback in this probe. Disable JAX preallocation before initialization; each engine process releases its allocations when it exits. The Matplotlib cache uses a writable temporary directory.
